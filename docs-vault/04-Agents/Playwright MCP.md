# Playwright MCP

For agents that speak the Model Context Protocol, attach the official Playwright MCP server to the [[CDP Endpoint]] — its snapshot/click/type tools then operate on the human-visible shared browser.

## Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add ui-observer -- npx @playwright/mcp@latest --cdp-endpoint http://127.0.0.1:9222
```

## Codex (one example; any MCP client works alike)

```toml
# ~/.codex/config.toml
[mcp_servers.ui-observer]
command = "npx"
args = ["@playwright/mcp@latest", "--cdp-endpoint", "http://127.0.0.1:9222"]
```

## Why this beats a headless MCP browser

- The human **sees every action** the agent takes and can intervene (fix a captcha, log in, point at the problem) — see [[Shared Browser Model]].
- Sessions survive agent restarts: the browser belongs to the [[Observer Server]], not to the MCP process.
- Login state created manually through noVNC is immediately usable by the agent ([[Profiles]]).

## Typical MCP session

1. `browser_snapshot` → see the accessibility tree of the current page.
2. `browser_click` / `browser_type` → interact; the human watches live.
3. `browser_take_screenshot` → immediate visual evidence.
4. For durable, structured evidence switch to the [[Mission Runner]] and read [[Findings]].

## Notes

- Requires the stack to be up (`make up`); check `scripts/observer health` first.
- The MCP server is a CDP *client* — the same limitations as [[Playwright over CDP]] apply (no native video/trace on the shared session).
