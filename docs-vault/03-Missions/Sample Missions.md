# Sample Missions

Three missions ship in `config/missions/`, each with a deterministic expectation against the [[Sample App]]. They double as living examples of the [[Mission Format]].

## generic-smoke — *must pass*

Basic visual and interaction validation of a happy path: home page, `Open dialog` modal, Escape to close, long-content scroll, overflow check, back/forward history, console/network capture. Declares all six [[Checks Reference]] with `favicon.ico` allow-listed.

```bash
make smoke        # expected: PASSED, 0 findings, exit 0
```

## error-hunt — *must fail*

Visits `/console-error` and `/network-fail`, the routes with intentional defects. Proves the observer actually detects problems:

```bash
make mission MISSION=error-hunt   # expected: FAILED, exit 1
```

Verified result: 9 [[Findings]] — uncaught exception (high), HTTP 500 (high), aborted request (high), console errors (medium), HTTP 403/404 (medium) — with the `Authorization` header shown as `[REDACTED]` in `network.json` ([[Secret Redaction]]).

## responsive-sweep — *finds layout breakage*

Loads `/responsive?broken=1` (fixed 1200 px element) and re-checks horizontal overflow at 1440 → 820 → 390 px using `set_viewport` ([[Actions Reference]]).

Verified result: 3 medium findings, each naming `div.card` as the offender with exact geometry (`scroll 1232px > client 375px` at phone width).

## Writing your own

Copy one of these as a starting point, keep the name kebab-case, and validate before running:

```bash
node apps/mission-runner/dist/cli.js validate config/missions/my-journey.yaml
make mission MISSION=my-journey
```

Point it at your own application via `target_url:` or [[Configuration]] — remember the host must be in the [[URL Policy]] allow-list.
