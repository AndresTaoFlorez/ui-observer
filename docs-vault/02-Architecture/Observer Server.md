# Observer Server

The Node/TypeScript process (`apps/observer-server/`) that owns the shared browser. It is one of six supervised programs inside the container (the rest form the [[Display Stack]]).

## Responsibilities

1. **Launch the shared Chromium** — `chromium.launchPersistentContext` with `headless: false` on display `:99`, exposing DevTools for the [[CDP Endpoint]]. The profile directory depends on the mode, see [[Profiles]].
2. **Serve the [[Control API]]** on port 8090 — navigation (guarded by the [[URL Policy]]), screenshots, captured console/network evidence.
3. **Collect evidence continuously** — an `EvidenceCollector` keeps ring buffers (2000 entries) of console messages, page errors and network activity from the shared context, all passed through [[Secret Redaction]] at capture time.
4. **Compute [[Health Model]] reports** — per-component checks, deliberately excluding the target application.
5. **Watch browser liveness** — if the shared browser dies (crash, or a human closes the window through noVNC), the process exits non-zero and supervisord relaunches everything fresh.

## Startup sequence

```
wait for X socket (/tmp/.X11-unix/X99)
  → launch persistent context (headed)
  → attach evidence collector
  → start Control API
  → navigate to UI_OBSERVER_TARGET_URL (best-effort: a dead target
    must never take the observer down — see Health Model)
```
